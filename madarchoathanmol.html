    <h1>From Love to Silence</h1>
    <p>The story of how a heart broke — piece by piece.</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Where It All Started</h2>
    <p>
      We were strangers once, and then something clicked. Every message, every smile, every word meant the world. There was comfort in your name, light in your texts, and peace in your presence. I fell, slowly at first — and then all at once.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Middle: Hope, Effort, Waiting</h2>
    <p>
      I replied in seconds. You took hours, then days. But I never complained. I thought maybe you were busy, maybe something was wrong. But you just weren’t feeling the same. Still, I kept trying. Kept loving. Kept believing.

  <section>
    <h2>The End: Silence Louder Than Words</h2>
    <p>
      No goodbye. No closure. Just distance — like I never existed. You stopped replying, and I started breaking. I craved even a ‘hmm’ from you, but nothing came. Now, I just carry the silence. It screams louder than anything you ever said.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What I Feel Now</h2>
    <p>
      I don’t feel happiness anymore. Just emptiness. Just pain. But I carry it with a smile. Because you were my everything, and I was just… an option.
      Maybe someday, this hurt will fade. Or maybe it’ll stay — a quiet reminder that I loved you too much, and you didn’t love me enough.
